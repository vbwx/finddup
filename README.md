## Description

This utility compares the contents of files to check if any of them match.
What is considered a match depends on the chosen method; three methods are available:

- *Heuristic comparison* (very fast)
- *Heuristic comparison with trimming* (useful for text and video files, or any files with padding bytes at the end)
- *Precise comparison* (slow but accurate)

For further processing of the results, you can choose between six output modes:

- One match per line
- Duplicate and original each on a separate line
- Only duplicates/originals
- Smallest/largest duplicates
- Oldest/newest duplicates
- Only unique files

There are many more options that let you control which files are ignored, which files are to be compared, how the utility should handle symbolic links, and whether to look for files in subdirectories.

## Installation

So far, I have used finddup only on macOS, therefore I can only describe how to install it on a Mac â€” although the instructions should work just as well on Linux.

### Installation via Homebrew

If [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is installed, you can run this command:

```sh
brew install vbwx/utils/finddup
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download and extract the [latest release](https://github.com/vbwx/finddup/releases/latest) of finddup.
2. Make sure you have at least version 5.16 of Perl installed.
3. Run the following commands.

```sh
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
```

## Usage

Run `finddup --help` to get a quick overview of how to use this utility.

### Examples

The following command calculates how much storage is taken up by duplicates in the entire file hierarchy of the working directory.

```sh
finddup -ra0 | xargs -0 du -ch --
```

Here is how to delete the newest exact copies of files located in different directories (a.k.a. keep only the originals):

```sh
finddup -pM0 some_folder another_folder | xargs -0 rm -f
```

Instead of running `diff` in a loop, finddup can be used to determine which files have changed, even across multiple copies of the original directory.

```sh
finddup -rn folder-v*/
```

### Manual

You can find a detailed explanation of all options, a tutorial, and more technical information in the [User Manual](Manual.md).
